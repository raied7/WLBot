# CSC Hacks Sample Project Repo

## Project Description

* I want to create a Discord bot that will keep track of user's wins and losses posted in the "wins-losses" channel of the CSC Discord server. The bot will keep a count of a user's wins and losses, and user's will be able to access their wins and losses on a specific day, week, month, and year. The bot will also react with gifs whenever a user posts their win/loss in the channel
* I will be using Node.js and Discord.js along with some sort of data storage for this bot, and it will be my first time doing any thing with JavaScript and online data storage.
